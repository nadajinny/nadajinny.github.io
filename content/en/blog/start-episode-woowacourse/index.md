Hello 👋
This is Jinsun Lee, back with my second post!

Recently, I submitted my application for the Woowa Tech Course, which had its deadline on October 10th.

In this post, I’d like to share what the Woowa Tech Course is, why I decided to join, and my mindset as I begin the first week of the precourse.

## Overview

1. What is the Woowa Tech Course?
2. Why did I apply for it?
3. How do I feel as I start Week 1?

### What is the Woowa Tech Course?

The Woowa Tech Course consists of the following stages:

- Application Period: September 29, 2025 (Mon) 3 PM – October 10, 2025 (Fri) 10 AM
- Precourse: October 14, 2025 (Tue) – November 17, 2025 (Mon)
- First Round Results: December 29, 2025 (Mon) 3 PM
- Final Coding Test: January 10, 2026 (Sat), offline (location to be announced)
- Final Results: January 23, 2026 (Fri) 3 PM
- Main Course Start: February 24, 2026 (Tue) 10 AM

The Precourse is open to everyone who submits an application.

Currently, there are over a thousand participants in the Discord server, myself included!

It’s an impressive number of people.

Over the course of four weeks, participants complete assignments to demonstrate their skills.

Based on their performance and personal statements, the first-round results are announced.

What’s particularly interesting is that the final coding test is not a traditional algorithm exam.

Instead, it evaluates participants on a task similar to those in the precourse — and it must be completed without using AI tools within a limited time frame.



## Why I Applied for the Woowa Tech Course

The biggest reason was that I wanted to collaborate with many different people.

As a junior, I began participating in various competitions and realized how rewarding it was to work with others, sharing ideas and building something together.

I admired teams who stayed up all night planning and coding together —
and, oddly enough, one of my college dreams was to experience that **“beer after an all-nighter”** satisfaction. 🍺

It might sound funny, but I always thought that would feel incredibly fulfilling! (and yes, my friends found it a bit strange too 😂)

So for me, working under time pressure isn’t stressful — it feels like a challenge.

That’s what led me to apply for the Woowa Tech Course: to take on that kind of meaningful challenge.

## Reflections After Week 1

Now that I’ve started the first week of the precourse, I feel nothing but excitement.

There’s still so much ahead that it feels too early to be nervous —

but I’m looking forward to seeing how much I can grow week by week


## My Determination

It might sound a bit dramatic to call it “determination,” but I’ll share my mindset honestly.

For me, the Woowa Tech Course represents a major step toward becoming a professional developer —
a bridge between university life and employment.

That’s why I truly want to do my best and pass.

Although over 1,000 people applied, only 25 will be selected for the Android development track I chose.

Even so, rather than focusing only on the outcome,

I want to enjoy this time fully and give my all throughout the process.

I’m currently juggling a tough schedule —

3rd year, 2nd semester, 24 credits, 3 mentoring programs, and 5 competitions —

so even if my grades take a small hit,

I’m determined to maximize my chances of success in this course.

Of course, if I don’t pass, it’ll be disappointing,

but I believe all the effort I’ve put in will still lead me somewhere better.

So, that’s my mindset and motivation as I begin this journey. 😄
