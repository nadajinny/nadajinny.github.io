Hello ðŸ‘‹

{{< toc mobile_only=true is_open=true >}}

## Overview

1. I recently joined the Medical Artificial Intelligence and Computational Science Laboratory at Jeonbuk National University.
2. I am responsible for development-related tasks in the lab. During the first half of 2025, I focused on app development using React Native (RN), and since the second half of the year, I have been expanding my skills into various frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and Flutter.
3. By developing AI-powered applications, I am continuously growing as a full-stack developer.

## How I Joined the Lab

As I became more ambitious about software development, I realized that self-study alone has its limits â€” my perspective was becoming narrower.

In that process, I started searching for better ways to continue learning, and I realized that joining a research lab would provide the most effective environment to learn while working on professional-level projects.

By joining the lab, I gained valuable time to reflect seriously on my goals and direction as a developer, which helped me plan my future path more clearly.

## My Work in the Lab

Currently, I am working as a frontend developer on various web and mobile projects within the lab.

- **Device Communication Application** â€“ Developed a system connecting devices and mobile phones via Firebase.
- **Medical Assistant Application** â€“ Participated in the full-stack development of an app designed to assist patients who face difficulties during medical consultations.
- **Health Status Monitoring Application** â€“ Developed the frontend of an application that analyzes and visualizes usersâ€™ health data.

## Reflections and Takeaways

Through my experience in the lab, I learned that real growth comes only from direct, hands-on experience with large-scale projects.

In the beginning, I lacked confidence in my development abilities.

However, by participating in various projects and collaborating with others, I gained a deeper understanding of how to approach real-world tasks effectively.

This also gave me time to better understand myself.

I realized that I truly have a passion for development â€” something I hadnâ€™t fully recognized before â€” and I started pushing myself beyond my current limits.

As a result, I felt a strong sense of progress and personal growth.

Feeling that growth firsthand sparked an even greater ambition in me â€” I now want to participate in competitions and explore broader opportunities in the field.
