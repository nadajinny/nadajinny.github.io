The WoowaTechCourse Pre-Course assignment this week was about GitHub!


When I first read the assignment, I thought about how I could structure the process in Kotlin.


However, as I started writing code, I realized that things often needed to be revised — some parts became more complex when I tried to separate them structurally, leading to continuous restructuring.


The biggest lesson I learned was that it’s better not to aim for perfection from the start, but rather to first write the code and then think about how to refactor and organize it more effectively.


While working with Kotlin, I kept revising my approach because there were so many features I could use.


Through this process, I realized that my knowledge of Kotlin was still lacking, so I decided that from next week onward, I should study the basics of Kotlin more thoroughly before proceeding.


It also took me much more time to write the code than I initially expected when I first read the problem.
Through this experience, I began to think about how I could improve my problem-solving skills.


I decided to experiment with time management — starting from the next assignment, I plan to set a time limit for solving problems, then spend a day reviewing and rewriting the code, and finally spend two more days analyzing and improving it.


Lastly, I thought it would be valuable to spend time considering how I could solve the same problem if the requirements were to change in a completely different direction.
